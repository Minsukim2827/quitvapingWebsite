          Quitting vaping improves health, reduces the risk of serious illness
          and saves money. It can be challenging but setting a quit date,
          finding alternatives, creating a support system and seeking
          professional help can make the process easier. It's worth the effort
          for a healthier life.

          Vaping has been linked to a number of health risks. The use of
          e-cigarettes, also known as vapes, has been associated with lung
          damage and respiratory illness. Studies have found that vaping can
          cause inflammation and damage to the airways, which can lead to
          chronic bronchitis and other lung problems.
        </p>

        <p class="risksText">
          Additionally, vaping has been linked to an increased risk of heart
          disease. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical
          Association (JAMA) found that e-cigarette use was associated with a
          71% increased risk of stroke and a 59% increased risk of myocardial
          infarction (heart attack).
        </p>

        <p class="risksText">
          Moreover, vaping has been associated with a number of other health
          risks, such as nicotine addiction, especially among young people. A
          report from the US Surgeon General in 2019 found that e-cigarette use
          among youth and young adults has increased significantly in recent
          years, and that e-cigarettes have become the most commonly used
          tobacco product among youth.
        </p>
        <p class="risksText">
          According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as
          of September 2019, more than 2,500 cases of e-cigarette, or vaping,
          product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) have been reported to CDC
          from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S.
          territories.
