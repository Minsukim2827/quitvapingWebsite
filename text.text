Vaping has been linked to a number of health risks. The use of e-cigarettes, also known as vapes, has been associated with lung damage and respiratory illness. Studies have found that vaping can cause inflammation and damage to the airways, which can lead to chronic bronchitis and other lung problems.

Additionally, vaping has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that e-cigarette use was associated with a 71% increased risk of stroke and a 59% increased risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Moreover, vaping has been associated with a number of other health risks, such as nicotine addiction, especially among young people. A report from the US Surgeon General in 2019 found that e-cigarette use among youth and young adults has increased significantly in recent years, and that e-cigarettes have become the most commonly used tobacco product among youth.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of September 2019, more than 2,500 cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) have been reported to CDC from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories.

It's important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the long-term health effects of vaping, but the available data suggests that vaping can be dangerous and it's important to be aware of the risks.
